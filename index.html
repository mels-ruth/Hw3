            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Melanie Rutherford and I am a 4th-year Behavioral Neuroscience major with a Data Science minor 
                at Northeastern University.
                I am from Connecticut and I have a younger sister named Nina. I live with 4 other roommates on Mission Hill, 
                We moved there a year ago and our apartment is so pretty.
                I really like living in Boston, I've found lots of fun things
                to do here and I think the people are really nice. I also love that we have a public transportation system, 
                I like being able to take the train and walk places instead of being in a car all the time, it makes my life 
                more fun. Most people complain 
                about the winters in Boston and how cold it is but I really don't mind, I like that we get all 4 seasons and I
                think as long as you have the right clothes, you can handle any weather. I spent this past summer in Copenhagen
                and Stockholm where it is famously cold and rainy, and the Swedes have a saying: "There is no bad weather, only 
                bad clothes", and I completely agree. Below is a photo of me at a restaurant in Stockholm. After this photo was
                taken I ate the most delicious plate of swedish meatballs.
