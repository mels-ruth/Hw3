            <h2>My Interests</h2>
            <p>In my free time, I like to sew, dance ballet, watch
                TV, read, and recently I've taken up knitting. I've been watching Gilmore Girls since it's getting colder
                and Gilmore Girls feels very "fall" to me. When I finish that show, I'm going to switch back to watching
                The Sopranos. I'm almost done with my current knitting project, a little hood/scarf combo thing (photo below). 
                I'm going to make another one when I finish in a new color and stitch, and I think I will give the first one 
                to my sister for Christmas. I've been dancing ballet for about 8 years now, I started when I was a freshman
                in high school and have continued dancing throughout college. I take classes at the Boston Ballet a few times a week
                and I used to dance in pointe shoes as well, but it's been a long time since I've been able to practice with them. I'm also about to start figure skating! A friend and I are planning to take lessons
                in January and I am very excited, I would love to be able to do some spins and tricks, and I think it would merge
                well with my ballet skills. I've been trying to read more this year and my favorite books I've read so far are 
                Pathogenesis by Johnathan Kennedy, Talking to Strangers by Malcolm Gladwell, and My Year of Rest and Relaxation by Otessa 
                Mosfegh. Right now I'm reading I who have never known men by Jaquelin Harpman. I like it so far but it's a very disorienting
                novel to read, it's taking me a while to get into it.
